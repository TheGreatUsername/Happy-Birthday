# Happy-Birthday

A colorful happy birthday HTML page

It's a simple HTML page. Just double click the file and it will open in 
the default browser and run. It makes use of the Canvas element to create
an animation where colorful balls will come out from the bottom of the
screen and fall down due to gravity physics I coded in.
